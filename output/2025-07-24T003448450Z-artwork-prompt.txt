The digital illustration is set in a serene coastal landscape at twilight, capturing the peaceful essence of the story. The scene showcases a young girl named Lila and her adventurous otter companion Finn, who are the central focal points in the bottom two-thirds of the image. Lila, a twelve-year-old with sandy brown hair and deep ocean-blue eyes, is wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, which provides a casual yet charming detail against the setting's muted, warm hues. She kneels beside a tide pool, her reflection mingling with the water's gentle swirls, as soft twilight lighting bathes the scene in hues of amber and rose.

Finn, the sleek-furred otter, stands beside her, his eyes twinkling with mischief and curiosity as he peers into the tide pool. The scene is beautifully framed by the ocean in the background, where the waves lap at the shore rhythmically, and the sky transitions to a tapestry of stars woven against the indigo night.

The vintage-inspired illustration style features bold, confident line work and a muted color palette, evoking a calming, retro aesthetic reminiscent of mid-century children's books. A subtle grain overlay gives the artwork a textured, nostalgic feel, enhancing its dreamlike quality.

In the center of the image, occupying the upper third, is the text "KEY TO SLEEP," elegantly centered and rendered in Bebas Neue font in all caps. The text is large yet carefully placed to ensure that every letter is completely visible within the frame, maintaining at least a 25% margin from all edges. This design element is seamlessly integrated, providing a visual hierarchy that complements the scene without overshadowing the main characters.

The composition balances illustrated elements with negative space, leaving ample breathing room around the edges. Lila and Finn are positioned as the heart of the image, embodying the story's gentle adventure and the comforting, sleepy atmosphere it intends to convey. The image evokes a sense of quiet wonder and connection to the natural world, inviting viewers to feel at peace and ready for rest.
