The digital illustration features a serene coastal scene, capturing the essence of Mia's and Finn's tranquil journey. The setting is a coastal cliffside, where the earth meets the sea. The sky is a canvas of muted blues and grays, hinting at the onset of twilight, while the sea stretches out with soft waves washing against rocky shores, reflecting hues of sunset oranges and soft browns.

At the lower two-thirds of the image, Mia, a twelve-year-old girl with ocean-like eyes, stands as the central focal point. She wears a knitted sweater in the shade of seafoam and sturdy boots, suggesting her readiness to explore the rocky paths. Beside her is Finn, her gentle fox companion, with fur the color of autumn leaves and bright, curious eyes. Finn stands close to Mia, his demeanor calm and attentive, adding a sense of companionship and comfort to the scene.

Mia's face is turned towards the horizon, capturing her thoughtful nature and the quiet wonder of the landscape. The scene is framed by the towering cliffs, with mosses and tiny wildflowers painting the gray stone with splashes of life, enhancing the feeling of a hidden, magical world.

Above them, in the center of the image, the bold text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed. The text uses the Bebas Neue font in all caps, perfectly centered with extremely large margins from all edges, ensuring every letter is fully visible without any cropping or bleeding. This placement provides ample breathing room around the text, maintaining the visual hierarchy and serene aesthetic.

The overall color palette is muted and warm, with the use of flat designs and limited shading, creating a vintage poster-like aesthetic reminiscent of mid-century children's books. A subtle grain or texture overlay gives the image a soft, dreamlike quality, evoking feelings of peace and tranquility.

This composition not only visually represents the story's setting and mood but also serves as a calming invitation to drift into a restful sleep, guided by Mia's gentle cliffside journey.
