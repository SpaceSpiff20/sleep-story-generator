In this digital illustration designed for a sleep podcast episode, we enter a tranquil coastal scene inspired by the story of Oliver and his companion, Mira the otter. The composition captures a serene moment in the lower two-thirds of the image where the main characters, Oliver and Mira, are the central focal points. Oliver, an 11-year-old boy with a thoughtful demeanor, is dressed casually in an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie. Oliver is sitting on a smooth stone at the edge of a small clearing, his eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the sun sets, painting the sky in soft hues of gold, pink, and deep indigo. By his side, Mira, the sleek otter, sits attentively, her fur shimmering in the moonlight, reflecting the gentle twinkle of stars.

The setting is beautifully framed by the coastal dunes, with tall grass swaying gently under the soft twilight breeze. In the background, a vast stretch of ocean shimmers under the moon's glow, and a hidden stream weaves through the rocks, adding a subtle sense of movement and life to the scene.

The upper portion of the image is reserved for the critical text "KEY TO SLEEP," ensuring it is completely visible with generous margins on all sides. The text is in the center of the image, using the Bebas Neue font in all caps, and is sized to maintain at least 25% margins from every edge, ensuring no letter is cropped or bleeding out of the frame. The text is integrated into the design, with its placement and size carefully balanced to complement the serene scene below.

The overall aesthetic of the illustration adheres to a vintage poster or mid-century children's book cover style. Bold, confident line work defines the characters and landscape, while a muted, warm color palette—featuring sunset oranges, deep blues, and soft browns—evokes a calming, peaceful atmosphere. Subtle grain and texture overlays the image, enhancing the retro feel and adding depth.

This illustration captures a peaceful, dreamlike quality, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the quiet adventure and gentle wonder of Oliver and Mira's story, perfectly setting the tone for a sleep-inducing podcast experience.
