The artwork depicts a serene scene featuring the main character, Oliver, and his companion, Luna the black cat. They occupy the central focal points in the lower two-thirds of the image. Oliver is depicted as a thoughtful 12-year-old boy with stormy sea-colored eyes, wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, the fabric a soft shade of dune grass. His pockets are subtly bulging with the outlines of smooth pebbles and tiny shells. Luna, sleek and black with eyes like liquid amber, stands poised next to him, her presence graceful and protective.

The setting is a tranquil coastal scene captured at twilight. The horizon stretches out with the sun dipping low, painting the sky in warm oranges and soft pinks, blending into the deep blues of approaching night. The ocean's waves softly lap against the sandy shore, and the cool sand beneath their feet is depicted with delicate, textured strokes, giving a tactile sense of comfort and calmness.

The image is framed to allow for generous negative space, enhancing the atmospheric tranquility. The composition follows a vintage poster aesthetic, with clean lines and flat design elements, utilizing a muted, warm color palette. The entire scene has a subtle grainy texture, invoking a sense of nostalgia and peacefulness.

Above Oliver and Luna, centered in the image, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed in the BEBAS NEUE font. The letters are bold and clear, perfectly positioned with a 25% margin from all edges to ensure no cropping or bleeding, making the text legible and integrated into the visual composition. This arrangement not only emphasizes the narrative's title but also maintains the essential balance between the text and the illustration.

Overall, the artwork captures the essence of the story's peaceful and dreamlike quality, inviting viewers into a world of quiet reflection and gentle wonder.
