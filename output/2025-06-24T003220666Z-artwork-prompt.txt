The scene is set in the vast, tranquil desert under a twilight sky adorned with the first specks of evening stars. The lower two-thirds of the image is dominated by the main character, Amir, and his fennec fox companion, Zuri. Amir, a thoughtful eleven-year-old with rich, dark amber eyes, stands at the center. He wears an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, the fabric softly rippling with the desert breeze. His hoodie features a muted palette of deep blues and sandy browns, matching the earth tones of the desert landscape.

Amir holds a simple walking stick, carved from an old olive tree, with its texture detailed to convey the wisdom of ages. Beside him, Zuri, the fennec fox, is depicted with large ears and soft, sandy fur that complements the golden sands around them. Her presence is lively yet serene, offering a sense of companionship and understanding with Amir.

The background frames the characters with gentle dunes and a serene desert basin. The sky above transitions from soft pinks and golds at the horizon to deeper blues at the top, sprinkled with emerging stars. The entire scene exudes a quiet, dreamlike quality, inviting the viewer into the peaceful embrace of a desert night.

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENTS:

Centered in the image, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is boldly displayed in Bebas Neue, all caps. The text respects the critical requirement of having a minimum 25% margin from all edges of the image, ensuring each letter is fully visible within the frame. The color of the text is warm white, standing out yet harmoniously blending with the overall color scheme, ensuring it is both prominent and aesthetically pleasing. The integration of text and imagery maintains a visual balance, with the text not overshadowing the serene depiction of Amir and Zuriâ€™s shared moment under the whispering desert sky.
