To create the artwork for the "Key to Sleep" episode featuring the story of Noah and Luna, the scene should encapsulate the serene and calming atmosphere of a tranquil coastline at dusk. Here’s how the illustration can come to life:

**Composition:**
- **Central Scene:** Noah, a 10-year-old boy with bright, inquisitive eyes, is sitting in an old wooden boat that rests on a calm, sandy cove. He is barefoot, his feet lightly touching the cool sand. Luna, the seagull with feathers the color of twilight clouds, is perched on the boat's edge, gazing out towards the horizon where the first stars twinkle.
- **Environment:** The background features towering cliffs framing the cove, with the ocean gently lapping against the shore. The sky displays a soft gradient from the coral and gold hues of the sunset to the deepening blues of twilight.
- **Mood and Atmosphere:** The overall mood is serene and contemplative, capturing the peaceful exchange between the earth and the sea. The gentle textures in the sand and the water add a tactile feel to the piece, enhancing the calming effect.

**Stylistic Elements:**
- **Vintage Poster-Inspired Look:** Use bold outlines to define the shapes of Noah, Luna, and the surrounding landscape. This gives the artwork a classic, timeless feel reminiscent of vintage travel posters.
- **Muted, Warm Color Palette:** Employ warm, soft colors to evoke a sense of calm and warmth. The colors should be slightly muted to match the dusk setting and to maintain a soothing visual tone.
- **Posterized Lighting:** Apply gentle lighting effects to highlight the ripples in the water and the textures in the cliffs, using a posterized style that simplifies the gradients and shadows for a smooth, cohesive look.
- **Characters’ Outfit:** Noah should be wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie or a t-shirt to subtly incorporate the brand into the artwork.

**Conceptual Focus:**
- **Emotionally Serene Atmosphere:** Capture the moment of reflection and contentment as Noah and Luna share the tranquility of the evening. The illustration should invite viewers to feel the calming embrace of the ocean’s lullaby.
- **Symbolism and Storytelling:** Use visual cues, like the gentle waves, the soft starlight, and the comfortable posture of Noah and Luna, to suggest themes of exploration, discovery, and a peaceful journey into slumber.

By combining these elements, the artwork will resonate with the calming, poetic nature of the podcast episode, inviting listeners into a journey of relaxation and dreams.
