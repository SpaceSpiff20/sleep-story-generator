In the digital illustration, Arlo and Luna are the central focal points, occupying the lower two-thirds of the image. Arlo, an eleven-year-old boy, is depicted with contemplative eyes and a gentle smile. He wears a light scarf around his neck, the color of a soft sky at dawn, and a navy blue APES ON KEYS hoodie with the hood down, adding a modern touch to his otherwise timeless presence. His pocket slightly bulges with a small notebook, hinting at his thoughtful nature. Beside him, Luna, the desert fox, sits attentively. Her fur, a warm sandy hue, complements the twilight tones of the setting, and her bright eyes reflect a sense of ancient wisdom.

The background captures the serene beauty of the desert at twilight. The sands glow softly under a sky painted with hues of coral and gold, as the sun makes its slow descent. Shadows stretch across the dunes, and a gentle breeze seems to ripple through the air, creating a sense of movement and life within the stillness. In the distance, the silhouette of a hidden oasis can be glimpsed, with hardy desert plants and a small glowing pool of water surrounded by rocks.

Above Arlo and Luna, the words "KEY TO SLEEP" are prominently displayed in the center of the image, using the Bebas Neue font in all caps. The text is perfectly centered and prominently placed, with at least a 25% margin from each edge of the image, ensuring full visibility and compliance with the critical text requirement. The text is integrated into the design, complementing the warm and tranquil mood, while allowing the viewer's eye to smoothly transition between the serene scene and the comforting message.

The visual style embraces a vintage poster aesthetic with bold lines and a muted, warm color palette. The overall composition balances negative space with the illustrated elements, creating a peaceful atmosphere that invites viewers into Arlo's world of introspection and gentle discovery. The artwork evokes feelings of comfort and sleepiness, embodying the spirit of the story and inviting the audience to join Arlo and Luna on their tranquil desert adventure.
