The digital illustration captures a serene and poetic scene set in the tranquil night desert, aligning with the story's essence. In the central lower two-thirds of the image, we see Mateo, an eleven-year-old boy with a gentle, thoughtful gaze. He's wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, which frames his dark hair that falls softly across his brow. Mateo stands barefoot on the cool, undulating sands of the desert, his posture relaxed as he gazes into the vastness.

Beside Mateo is Rumi, his loyal fox companion. Rumi's fur glows with a warm, amber hue in the twilight, her intelligent eyes watching the horizon with a quiet understanding. The fox sits patiently, tail wrapped around her paws, leaving delicate prints in the sand.

The background features the sweeping dunes of the desert under a sky blanketed with stars, each one twinkling like tiny lanterns guiding the way. The deep blues and soft browns of the night seamlessly blend with the muted oranges of the setting sun, creating a calming, dreamlike atmosphere. Shadows cast by the dunes add depth to the landscape, while the gentle curve of the sands leads the eye towards a distant caravan of camels, silhouetted against the starry sky.

In the center of the image, occupying the upper third, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed. The words are written in bold, all-caps Bebas Neue font. The text is perfectly centered, with each letter fully contained within the frame, ensuring no part of the text bleeds over the edges. A generous margin surrounds the text, allowing it to breathe against the serene backdrop. The typography's color subtly contrasts with the twilight tones of the desert, ensuring clarity and focus.

The overall composition is balanced, with ample negative space that accentuates the peacefulness of the scene. The illustration's vintage poster aesthetic, characterized by bold lines and a soft grain overlay, evokes a nostalgic and calming quality, inviting the viewer to delve into the story's quiet adventure and gentle wonder.
