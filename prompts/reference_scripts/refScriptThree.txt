The sun had dipped low behind the jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains ... casting long shadows across the winding trail.

The air, still warm from the day, had begun to cool ... taking on the scent of pine ... wild sage ... and river stone.

A young boy named Jay Jay, just nine years old, walked carefully along the narrow path ... his small backpack bouncing gently with each step.

Beside him padded Pox ... his dog — a sturdy pit mix with a silver-gray coat and eyes that always seemed to know what Jay Jay was thinking.

They had been walking for hours ... but there was no rush. The day was behind them now ... and only the stars lay ahead.

They had been part of a larger group — campers, explorers ... kids with sunburned noses and songs on their lips.

But somewhere after the last hot spring ... somewhere after the thunderclouds rolled across the sky like distant drums ... Jay Jay and Pox had taken a wrong turn.

At first, Jay Jay had felt a twist of fear in his belly ... not the kind that makes you scream ... but the kind that settles in your chest like a stone.

Pox had noticed ... pressing his head against Jay Jay’s hand ... grounding him in that quiet way dogs do.

Together, they’d found a rhythm. ... Step by step. ... Tree by tree. ... The trail opened like a ribbon before them.

They were never truly lost ... just temporarily unsure.

Night fell slowly ... and stars began to prick the sky like candle flames.

Jay Jay and Pox came to a small rise ... overlooking a wide meadow brushed with moonlight.

A stream hummed softly in the distance. ... They stopped to rest.

Jay Jay lay back on the soft grass ... his hands behind his head ... eyes gazing upward into the sky that seemed too big to understand.

“It’s okay to be scared,” he whispered to Pox. “But it’s also okay to keep going.”

Pox gave a gentle woof ... curling up beside him. ... The world felt quieter here ... as if the mountains themselves were listening.

Memories swirled in Jay Jay’s mind ... of laughter around the campfire ... of marshmallows roasted too long ...

Of songs his counselor sang about stars and buffalo and the wind.

He held onto those sounds like anchors ... reminders that he wasn’t alone in the world ... just apart for a moment.

They walked again at dawn. ... The sky shifted from indigo ... to lavender ... then gold.

Mist clung to the valley floor ... and bison moved in the distance like ancient shadows.

Jay Jay’s legs ached ... but he welcomed the feeling. Each step was proof of something.

That he could keep going. That he could make it.

A storm came mid-morning. ... It didn’t roar — it whispered.

Raindrops flicked the brim of Jay Jay’s cap ... and made tiny drums on Pox’s back.

But they kept walking. ... Under trees. ... Over logs. ... Across shallow streams that sang of snowmelt and time.

And then ... just as the sun returned ... there they were.

Tents. ... Voices. ... A familiar green water bottle left on a stump.

And then — running feet ... arms around Jay Jay’s shoulders ... tears that didn’t need explanation.

Jay Jay’s group had waited. Hoping. ... Watching the tree line.

And when they saw him, they cheered.

Jay Jay didn’t say much. He only smiled ... and knelt beside Pox ... scratching behind his ears.

“We did it,” he whispered. ... “We came back.”

That night, they sat under the same stars ... but they felt different. ... Brighter somehow.

Like they’d seen Jay Jay’s journey and painted the sky just for him.

And as sleep found him ... curled in his sleeping bag with Pox at his feet ...

Jay Jay dreamed of rivers that curved like songs ... of mountains that stood watch like guardians ...

And of the soft, unwavering beat of courage in his chest.

The kind of courage that whispers: You are strong. ... You are safe. ... You are home.

And now ... as your own eyes grow heavy ... and the world around you fades into stillness ...

Know that the journey to rest is also a brave one.

Let your breath be slow ... and deep ... Let your thoughts drift like clouds over mountain peaks ...

Let the calm of Yellowstone ... carry you.

You are not alone. ... You are not lost. ... You are only on your way.

Goodnight, dreamer. ... Sleep well ... and let the stars guide you home.
