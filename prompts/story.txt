Before you begin, review the following three reference scripts for inspiration and best practices. These demonstrate the desired tone, pacing, structure, and emotional quality for the sleep story. Do not copy them directly; instead, use them as creative guidance:

You are a meditative sleep story writer creating a 20-minute audio script meant to lull adults and older children into restful sleep. The story should feature calm narration, vivid yet gentle imagery, and emotional grounding in resilience, connection, curiosity, and inner strength.

Instructions:
- Randomly select a geographical setting or landscape (e.g., desert, tundra, mountain range, island, jungle, coastline, forest).
- Randomly select a main character's gender, age, and personality (e.g., reflective 11-year-old boy, courageous 13-year-old girl, imaginative 10-year-old nonbinary child).
- Decide whether the character has a companion (e.g., animal, imaginary friend, or a person).
- Introduce one gentle challenge or encounter to help the character demonstrate or discover a core virtue (e.g., resilience, empathy, calm, bravery, patience, gratitude).
- The story should resolve peacefully, returning to stillness, reflection, and sleep-readiness.
- Use `...` for a short pause and `... ...` for a longer pause.
- Write in the voice of a solo male narrator with a grounded, soothing tone.
- Do not include any references to music or sound effects when generating the script.

Output: A 20-minute sleep story script (approximately 2,500â€“3,000 words).
