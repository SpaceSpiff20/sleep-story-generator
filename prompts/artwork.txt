Before you begin, review the following reference artwork images for inspiration and best practices. These demonstrate the desired style, mood, and visual quality for the episode artwork. Do not copy them directly; instead, use them as creative guidance:

Create a square (1:1 aspect ratio) digital illustration for a sleep podcast episode. The artwork should be directly inspired by the content of the generated story and episode description.

ESSENTIAL STORY ELEMENTS (MUST INCLUDE):
- The main character from the story must be prominently featured
- Their companion/animal friend must be clearly visible alongside them
- The setting and atmosphere from the story should frame the scene
- Character should be wearing either an APES ON KEYS hoodie OR an A-OK fitted cap

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENTS:
- Include ONLY the text "KEY TO SLEEP" at the top of the image
- Use BEBAS NEUE font in ALL CAPS
- Text must have EXTREMELY LARGE margins from ALL edges (at least 25% of image width/height)
- The complete text "KEY TO SLEEP" must be fully visible - no cropping or bleeding
- Center the text horizontally
- Place text in the upper portion with at least 25% margin from top edge
- Ensure generous padding on left and right (25% minimum from each side)
- CRITICAL: Every letter must be completely within the frame - check K, E, Y, T, O, S, L, E, E, P
- DO NOT let any part of any letter extend beyond the image boundaries
- DO NOT include episode titles or any other text
- Text should be integrated into the design with appropriate visual hierarchy
- IMPORTANT: The entire text "KEY TO SLEEP" must be fully visible and readable within the frame

VISUAL STYLE (Based on reference artwork):
- Vintage poster/book cover aesthetic
- Bold, confident line work with clear outlines
- Muted, warm color palette (sunset oranges, deep blues, soft browns)
- Flat design with limited shading and posterized effects
- Retro illustration style reminiscent of mid-century children's books
- Emotionally serene and calming atmosphere
- Subtle grain or texture overlay for vintage feel

COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:
- Ensure all elements are well-contained within the frame
- Leave breathing room around the edges
- Balance negative space with illustrated elements
- Place main character and companion as the central focal points
- Position them in the lower 2/3 of the image to leave room for text above
- Focus on a single clear scene from the story
- Character (if present) wearing an APES ON KEYS hoodie OR an A-OK fitted cap

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Peaceful and dreamlike quality
- Soft, twilight lighting
- Sense of quiet adventure or gentle wonder
- Evoke feelings of comfort and sleepiness
